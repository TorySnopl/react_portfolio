## What I Learned

This is my first attempt at building a website using React. I must admit that it was a challenge to think of the various parts of the site as components of the end product rather than one whole piece. Once I was able to switch into that mindset, I could see the benefit of being able to reuse components without having to rewrite the code.

I am looking forward to learning more about react and in particular react native to build powerful and flexible apps.
